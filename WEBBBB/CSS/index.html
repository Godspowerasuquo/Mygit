                    <h2 >WE EITHER LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM</h2>
                    <P>Dogs are domesticated mammals known for their loyalty, intelligence, and companionship.
                    <p>Originating from wolves, they have been close human allies for thousands of years.</P>
                    <p>With hundreds of breeds, they serve various roles such as pets, service animals, and working partners.</p>
                    <p>Dogs are highly social and require proper care, training, and affection,<del> they are all the same</del> <ins>they come in variety</ins>.</p>

                <p>Types of Dogs</p>

                    <li>French Bulldog</li> 
                    <li>Labrador</li>

                <p class="V"> I love dogs, but my favourite has to be the <strong>Maltese,</strong> <em> Canis lupus familiaris. </em> </p>
                <p>Maltese dogs are small, affectionate, and playful companions known for their long, silky white coats and charming personalities. </p>
                <p>Originating from the <small>Mediterranean</small> island of Malta, , they are one of the oldest toy breeds and are loved all over the world.</p>
                <p>The same way we have cute dogs like the Maltese, not so cute dogs exist as well, such as <b>Pitbulls</b></p>
                <p>Not very cute</p>
                <p>Pitbulls are medium-sized, muscular dogs known for their strength and loyalty. <br>Originally bred for bull-baiting and later as farm and family dogs, they are often misunderstood due to their history and appearance. Despite their reputation, well-trained and socialized pitbulls are friendly, loving, and excellent with children. They are active, intelligent, and require regular exercise and positive reinforcement training. With the right training Pitbulls can be great dogs. <br> They might not be for me but they might be for you.</p>
